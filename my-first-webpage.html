            I've begun working through the first weeks repo, learning about computer science and the basics of HTML and CSS. 
            I also learnt what <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> stands for!

        In this evening's bootcamp session we reviewed the basics of HTML and CSS and then were shown how to use the Inspect tool in the browser to analyse what elememts make up a website. 
        We then had some time to work with our our partner to do some pair programming and try to recreate the google webpage. 
        During the pair programming it was good to see that practicing the push/pull Git flow was paying off.

        I have only been able to complete a small amount of coding over the last couple of days, so today I was able to set the whole day aside to work on this weeks repo tasks. 
        <br>
        <h4>Skills focussed on today:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">Markdown</a> - a way of formatting text that is often used in blogs.</li>
            <li>More CSS - practiced selectors using the <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> task</li>
            <li>Command line - how to navigate through files and folders using the terminal</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        I found it difficult to stay focussed after a few hours of learning, so in future I will try and break the learning into smaller chunks of time rather than setting a whole day aside.  
        I had one problem with the Line Commander task, I kept getting the error "bash: rev: command not found", and couldn't find a quick fix for this. I was able to find a way to complete the task without that command, but need to investigate this more</p>

            Today I met with my team on Zoom to discuss our progress so far. We shared the code we had done already, and ideas for our websites. 
            It was great to talk with other people and see that we are all in a similar position with regards to our progress - and agreed that it's easy to think that everyone else is way ahead of you!
            We have planned to meet again later in the week to share out website progress and complete some code reviews.
